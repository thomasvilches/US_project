**Main changes**
I still need to test them
- vac_selection(): this function selects people to be vaccinated
- vac_time(): this function vaccinates people over the time.
- vac_update(): this function updates the vaccinated people status when the efficacy is implemented

**To Do List**

- change the vaccination rate vector in the parameters (fd_1)
- change the "days_change_vac_rate" vector: this one says when the rate will be changed
- add a parameter called "prop_vac_age" that contains the proportion of vaccines that are given to people in each age group
- change data to put all the dosis in a single dataset
